# EPICS - Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering Education

[EPCIS](https://engineering.purdue.edu/EPICS) is a service-learning design program for students. It is partnered with many industries across different fields to help students impact the society directly through various projects.
One such project I was working in 2015 was an outreach program called [Purdue Space Day](https://engineering.purdue.edu/PurdueSpaceDay), which is a single day event for elementary, middle school and high school students to learn about aerospace from college students through various fun activities.

For that purpose, I designed an experiment to help the students understand the concept of angular momentum by developing a chair on which a person can sit and use lever to turn the wheel that is rotating at high speed to increase or decrease the rotation of the chair. Below is the design of that chair.
