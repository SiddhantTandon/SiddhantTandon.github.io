# Navigation and Guidance of Aerospace Vehicles

**Project Description:** AEROSP 584 course taught by Dr. Dennis Bernstein, Fall 2020, University of Michigan.

### Position Fixing
Position fixing can be explained through the following example, let's assume we are at a beach and we want to figure out our position. We can see three lighthouses (our references) and can determine the [bearing angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_(navigation)) respectively. Using this information we can get a fix on our location.


### Extended Kalman Filter
I also implemented an EKF for estimating spacecraft trajectory using reference (measurement) signals at differnt time intervals for correction. The example is shown below.


### Pursuit-Evasion Games
One of the applications of guidance and navigation can be found in pursuit-evasion. Using different guidance laws like direct pursuit, proportional pursuit, and constant bearing pursuit I was able to study the various ways in which a vehicle could reach its target. Below are few examples on the same.
