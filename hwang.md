# Flight Dynamics and Control/Hybrid Systems Lab

[Dr. Inseok Hwang](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ihwang/) is a Professor in Aeronautics and Astronautics Department at Purdue University, where he leads the [Flight Dynamics and Control/Hybrid Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/fdchsl/home).

While I was involved with [SPECTRE](spectre), I went to Dr. Hwang to get some experience working with drones in his lab. Soon after I was supervised by Ph.D. student [Chiyu Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chiyu-zhang-171766a3/) as we researched on various [SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) methods that could be used by an autonomous vehicle in a GPS-denied environemt, for example, indoor environments, like inside a building.

After that I researched with undergraduate students on installing ROS packages on an Unmanned Ground Vehicle the lab built.
