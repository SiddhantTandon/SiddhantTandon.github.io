## About Me

I am a second year M.S.E candidate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering in 2019.

My home is in New Delhi, the capital city of India. Since high school, I have taken part in many activities that have helped me define my personality. It started with taking part in acting classes, directing short stage plays and becoming a judge for the [Chinh India Kids Film Festival](www.chinh.in). Then I got interested in developing science projects, and developed a carbon-footprint model for households to reduce electricity consumption that won me first place in State-level competition and led me to represent my high school in the National Competition against 600 more students from all over the country. My ability to conduct research at that age allowed me to pursue my dream of working on aerospace vehicles at Purdue University, after graduating from high school in 2014.

I have few hobbies like reading books on topics under science, technology, self-help, neuroscience, psychology and business. Others include watching Esports (mostly [League of Legends](www.lolesports.com)), exercising (I follow [AthleanX](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDCav24), [10 min TABATA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1kS5I99dlM), etc.) and sketching.
