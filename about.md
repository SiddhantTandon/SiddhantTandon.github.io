## About Me

I am a second year M.S.E candidate in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan. I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering in 2019.

My hometown is New Delhi, the capital city of India. I have few hobbies like reading books on topics under science, technology, self-help, neuroscience, psychology and business. Others include watching Esports (mostly [League of Legends](https://lolesports.com/)), exercising (I follow [AthleanX](https://www.youtube.com/user/JDCav24), [10 min TABATA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1kS5I99dlM), etc.) and sketching. I have also traveled to many countries and think of myself as a global citizen.

Two things I like about nature:

Mountains!
