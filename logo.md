## Logo Design

<img src="images/Logo2-5_crop.gif"/>

This is my first attempt at designing a logo. I wanted to capture all elements of my interests and what defines me. Hence I went for my initials S and T which are formed by these 'vehicles.' It also highlights my career ambition to work with multi-agent systems.

The comic look and background was developed using the iOS application [FlipaClip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flipaclip-create-2d-animation/id1101848914). The first transition shows unmanned agents moving autonomously. Second phase is the convergence of multi-agent systems to form the intials S and T.  Lastly, the bold outline of the paths is a reference to uncertainty quantification where improving the estimation of position of each of the agents is increasing our confidence in the posterior information.
