# Gorodetsky Group: Computational Autonomy

[Dr. Alex Gorodetsky](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/alex-gorodetsky/) is an Assistant Professor in Aerosapce Engineering at the University of Michigan, where he leads the [Computational Autonomy Group](https://www.alexgorodetsky.com/index.html).

I started my graduate research under him in May 2020 on data-driven machine learning with the aim of finding cost functions that a player seeks to minimize when playing a game, by using only the game data.

We are collaborating this research with [Dr. Shravan Veerapaneni](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~shravan/) and his Ph.D. student Brian Chen from the Mathematics Department at the University of Michigan. 

If you'd like to know more please reach out to me!
