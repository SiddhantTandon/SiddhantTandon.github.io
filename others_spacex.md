A project requested by former astronaut and the second man to walk on the Moon, Dr. Buzz Aldrin, to verify whether 1 million people can be sent to Mars with a $200000 ticket. The project can be found [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAECourses/aae450/2017/spring).

### Science Team
I was part of the science team, that was created to help with various mission logistics as well as designing settlement spaces for humans on Mars. Some other responsibilities were calculating exposure rate to radiation, developing exercising routines for colonists, finding minerals for construction, studying various agricultural methods for food production, calculation of nitrogen and other important minerals that need to be transported from Earth to help grow plants in Martian soil, etc.
