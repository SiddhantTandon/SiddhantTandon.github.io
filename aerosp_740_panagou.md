# Multi-agent Control


**Project Description:** AEROSP 740 course by Dr. Dimitra Panagou, Winter 2020, University of Michigan.

## Project 1: Graph Networks and Formation

The first project I had to understand various graph networks (through which single agents can recieve signals or send signals or do both) and implement them on agents to see how they behave and form formations. By using graph theory we treat multi-agents as vertices of a graph and the signals between them as the edges.

The different types of graphs I tested and developed controllers for are shown below in the videos (developed using MATLAB).

The first three videos are multi-agent systems attaining a formation in which they are 100 m apart from each other horizontally and vertically.
The last three videos are on multi-agent circular formation.

Directed-path network is shown below in which, each agent is connected with two adjacent agents in the network and the signal between two agents is in one direction. More on directed-paths can be found [here](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph/).

Undirected Complete Graph is shown below, where each agent is connected with every other agent and can send and receive signals. More on undirected graphs can be found [here](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/41graph/).

Undirected Path Graph is shown below, which is similar to directed path graph above, with the only difference that between two connected agents the signal can travel both directions.

## Project 2: Collision Avoidance and Safe Path Planning

The second project emphasized the use of control lyapunov functions and control barrier functions to build multi-agent controllers that are safe for operation. We can optimize for safe path planning formation,
