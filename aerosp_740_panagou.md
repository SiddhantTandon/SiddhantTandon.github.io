# Multi-agent Control


**Project Description:** AEROSP 740 course by Dr. Dimitra Panagou, Winter 2020, University of Michigan.

## Project 1: Graph Networks and Formation

The first project I had to understand various graph networks (through which single agents can recieve signals or send signals or do both) and implement them on agents to see how they behave and form formations. By using graph theory we treat multi-agents as vertices of a graph and the signals between them as the edges.

The different types of graphs I tested and developed controllers for are shown below in the videos (developed using MATLAB):

Directed-path network is shown below in which the signals between two agents are in one direction. More on directed-paths can be found [here](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph/):
