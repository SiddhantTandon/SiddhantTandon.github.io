# Planetary Systems and Surfaces Lab

[Dr. David Minton](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/minton/index.html) is an Assistant Professor in the Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Science Department at Purdue University, where he leads the [Planetary Systems and Surfaces Lab](https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/minton/).

During summer of 2016, I interned in his lab as an undergrduate summer intern, where I assisted Ph.D. student [Andrew Hesselbrock](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Andrew-J-Hesselbrock-2026045825). I was tasked with performing a numerical simulation of impact debris disk formed from an impact on Mars, for various mass and sizes of particles, to test the accretion rate of the disk. This would help Dr. Hesselbrock, with his research thesis on understanding the formation of Phobos and Deimos, Mars' moons.
